the html file 'phylumfinal' creates a graph of the relative abundance of phyla in the pumice and negative control.

the html file 'orderfinal' creates a graph of the relative abundance of order in the pumice and negative control.

The sample files  are three replicate pumice rock samples collected from a submarine erupted volcano in the South Pacific ocean. 

there is also a sequence dataset of a negative control ( DNA extraction from sterile water carried out in parallel to sample DNA extraction)

this project requires DADA2 and phyloseq packages in addition to usually required packeges.
